# Introduction
Hello, my name is **Garvin Mo Zhen**. Currently, I am a third year at UCSD studying Cognitive Science with a minor is Computer Science. Check out more about me as a [programmer](#me-as-a-programmer) and as a [person](#me-as-a-person)

## me as a programmer:
I first started coding when I took AP Computer Science in High School, and then took a few more courses in college. It was alright at first, but I wasn't sure if it was something I really enjoyed. As I took more classes, I discovered that I really enjoy working with data. And after my first internship, I was exposed to full stack development, which I also enjoyed. My favorite programing language is **Python**.

I also really like programming because Steve once said:
> everybody in this country should learn how to program a computer because it teaches you how to think

Seems pretty inspirational to me. I also made a really basic portfolio website, still working on it unfortunately, but check it out [here](https://garvinmozhen.com/).

Here some code on my favorite sorting algorithm:
```
def quicksort(arr):
    if len(arr) < 2:
        return arr
    else:
        pivot = arr[0]
        smaller, bigger = [], []
        for ele in arr[1:]:
            if ele <= pivot:
                smaller.append(ele)
            else:
                bigger.append(ele) 
    return quicksort(smaller) + pivot + quicksort(bigger)
```

## me as a person:
Outside of school I enjoy:
- playing volleyball
- trading stocks
- watching anime or anything 
- listening to music
- playing games mostly just league
    - check out a screenshot of my account [here](league.png)

Top 3 shows that I can think of:
1. Attack on titan
2. Jujutsu Kaisen
3. Rick and morty

# Things I need to do this year
